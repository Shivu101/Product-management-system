      Project Title - Product Management System (I took it for 'ANIMAL PRODUCT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM' as my project title)
      
      Technology Used - Html/Css, Javascript, Bootstrap, AngularJS.
      ....................................................................................
       
       In this project i have select to make this management system for Animals, because i want to make this project something different from 	    exact look of ecommerce clothing or technology websites and also because it gives me a interest to work with.
      
      
      My asumptions and techniques used for this Project - 
      
       My first assumption is always to complete a project with proper planning, interest and understanding the requirements which needed like - 	installation of any software, technologies updation which will be usefull to project, CDN links(if needed) and more new things.
      
      	New Techniques- By using bootstrapping it save more time to formatting and wrapping the entire page easily.
      	With the help of CDN links(Content Distribution Network)- then using the bootstrap documents is very helpful so i used this in my 	    project(like- Navbar, Image-slider Crousel, circling the images of child and more).
 
       -> I start this project by dividing into three parts- HomePage, ProductListPage, ProductDetailsPage.
             
       -> It works on three form- Desigining, Logic, Wrapping all.
    
     * For Desigining - used new Bootstrap techniques to make the designing more easy readable and formatting. 
                        
                        ex- <nav class="navbar navbar-inverse navbar-static-top">
                        we don't need to do more css styling for navbar.
                        
                        Also by CSS single line shortcuts it is easy to style particular <p>, <header>, <img> tags easily.
                        
                        ex-  <img src="images/boy.jpeg" alt="boy 1 image" class="img-circle animated wobble" width="140" height="140">
 				(by circle animated wobble- image changes to circle design).
                        
      * For Logic -  By using Javascript it is easy to minimize code for doing some dynamic things by some few lines of code.
                     ex- i use Toggle button by action with javascript easy.
                       
                       
     * Wrapping all - At last, wrapping all the pages ansd styles in three folders to easy usable (Home, ProductList, ProductDetails).
     
    	 Raeson for motivation to completing this project- I always wants to use my learning technologies in implementing on practical projects 	 and this project gives me to use all well new techniques to implement on it.
     
     => I worked on HTML/CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap and not used "AngularJS" in this project, because i was started learning Angular-2 version	  onwards and it is very different from AngularJS, I tried but it takes more time to learned it and used it in this project. But Now,i'm learning AngularJS and complete this project by AngularJS also.

I hope if i'll get a chance to work with, Sure i'll give my best to enhance my skills to prove myself and be a part for achieving the goals of a company.
